In this work, we propose S-MPTCP, which realizes coupling control to MPTCP connections in network based on SDN. Leveraging global network information, network resources are fully explored and allocated to each connection in a fair manner. According to this basic design idea, routing and load balancing modules are improved. Under S-MPTCP’s control, subflow’s throughput will stabilize around its expected throughput which is allocated by SDN controller, and meanwhile congestion can be alleviated effectively.
