Researchers observed that MPTCP's throughput is lower than that of single path TCP in mmWave-LTE networks in previous works. According to experiments, we identify that the slow start scheme is the key reason leading to severe packet reordering problem and consequent throughput degradation. We design novel slow start algorithm BESS for MPTCP to address above problem, which is based on estimation of BDP. Check out <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8690815">this paper</a> for more details.
